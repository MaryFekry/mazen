			<h1 class="border">DEAR LADY MY NAME IS MAZEN,</h1>
			<p>I am a liberal minded, moderate practicing Muslim. My work background is as a preciouses Investor and short time business owner. I have 
earned a diploma in Business Management. I was never married or have children. I was born in Cairo Egypt in 1964, and 
came to the states (Michigan) at the age of two when my father was offered a job in Architectural Engineering as he 
sought a better life for us. My father (passed away), Egyptian, my mother is Lebanese. I have been for some years become financially 
secured (by God’s will), my disabled brother (only sibling) recently passed, may he be cared for better then even I 
would provide for him now in the hands of God. These are primary factors making it easy to marry now with lifetime security and
peace of mind, in newly realized good possession to settle down with a small family, 
(biological child or adoption by Islamic guideline), with comfort and a good quality of life.</p>

			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY FAMILY &amp; PROPHET'S BLOOD LINE</h1>
			<p>




My father Mohamed Said Halim (known as Said Halim in Michigan, USA) was a successful architect and engineer in Egypt 

before resuming his career in the states. He was the President and head Estimator for Atlas Engineering in Egypt at that time.  

He contributed countess hours of work in expanding the large Suni Mosque in Dearborn Michigan, in which a very respected 

Egyptian Sheikh / Imam, Mohamed Musa, who was sermon there at that time, knew my father well. My father at the time had 

health issues, and he refused to accept a penny for his services. He was a very privately charitable man at heart 

(as we discovered numerous charitable donation documents of his after his death).

The well respected Sheikh / now retired Imam can tell you all about my father (upon request) and knowledge of myself having 

gotten to know me.</p> 




<p>I so happen to proudly be part of the Prophet’s (PBUH) bloodline (Ashraf), as both family sides are decedents of.  

However this bares extra responsibility in trying to uphold the Prophets values and family name.</p>

			<h1 class="border border-txt">MORE ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p>Three words my friends would use to describe me would be kind, compassionate, and patient. I have a strong desire to 
uplift and provide for the people and causes I care about. I do not smoke, drink, take recreational drugs, gamble, or 
engage in premarital sexual affairs. I am in good over all health, and take select supplements. I have an excellent 
genetic profile with a Telomere Length (genetic aging) test at 90 percentile.</p><p> Some positive attributes that I would use to try honestly describe myself would be easy going, unconditionally faithful, honest,
understanding, caring, sensitive, having integrity, respectful, just, helping, open and broad minded, patient, humble, have
a subtle sense of humor, creative as well as intellectual, exhibiting a strong sense of strengthened fiscal responsibility. It is a deeply
intricate part of my inner being, that sometimes seems almost forsakenly suppressed due to some difficulty in expressing
certain emotions, mainly in public, in the private romantic element of my self. However as I am now realizing in developing a
deep relationship, such emotions, would seem more of an oddity, as this is an intricate part of whom I essentially am, thus
inevitable, and will naturally be displayed on various levels and means. It is my greatest wish to find the woman I can cherish,
protect, and provide for, to cater to her most sensitive needs, all out of my most genuine of heart.</p><p>We all have vices or negative traits, so in taking pride in being honest, as part of my nature, I mention one that most apparently
comes to mind. Occasionally, I tend to be stubborn, yet my good sense of pride brings me down in realizing when I am in
error, with admission of wrong, and apology. I also tend to be effected by injustice in this world a little too much perhaps, thus
I may get in verbal arguments or it may stick to my ribs a bit long. However being a very peaceful person in my nature, I never
have nor ever see myself in anything more then a verbal dispute, rather more just simply making known my displeasure and that
I am aware of the misdeed. It seems that I am learning to take things more in stride in years past.</p><p>Another example is business related such as if I pay someone to do something, I expect it to be done relatively to perfection.
For example if I was to have some work done in my home, maybe I would see thing that others would not notice unless I
drew their attention to them, but I think this may be in part to a  little OCD I have.  Another example is of personal record keeping
of my self or family, or more serious issues such as false medical records.</p><p>However, as to general moral traits of people, I tend to be very tolerant of such, as long as there is not great malicious intent to
cheat or do injustice, and even if mistakenly done, to acknowledge and attempt to rectify or compensate as best ability, weather
to a family member, friend, or even a common stranger. Again, I think I have learned to sober a bit over the years.</p>

			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY INTERESTS</h1>
			<p>I really love being self-employed. I not long ago registered an Import / Export fashion business, in hopes of acquiring
invaluable knowledge and opening a business or trade company. I have gained a wealth of 
experience in sample and small orders. My dream and very realistic anticipation is to soon open a small select merchandise shop and
eventually open a trade showroom, perhaps offering a wholesale option to buyers initially as well.
This  industry allows me to use my creative eye and design my own brand as well as provide me a great work / life 
balance.</p><p>I  enjoy going to the movies, fine dining, playing basketball with high skill, watch sports. It gives me great 
pleasure in trying different activities or go to events my mate desires. I would enjoy spending plenty of time with my 
soul mate, child to be, family, and new founded friends. I started writing poetry in High School. Most of my writings are based on my
reflections on life and its meaning. I have been mostly influenced by the works of Edgar Allen Poe and have a deep 
admiration for the writings of Rumi as well. I also have a passion for travel. I have traveled a good number of times to
Egypt where I have family, particularly the cities of Cairo, and a couple occasions to Alexandria. I have visited Rome as a youngster and
Toronto Canada. I would love to visit even more places, especially with that special someone. If I was to have a second home (God willing), I 
would love to live in Malaysia due to its amazing architecture, natural landscape, culture, and low cost but high
lifestyle living.</p>
