			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY DREAM OF AMBITION</h1>
			<p>I Have A Dream ….. When I was young, I had a very profound religious experience that lasted with intensity for days, 
unlike any conceivable earthly feeling. Too be short and to the point, the best way I could describe it was as if I 
could see a real bright white light in my chest (as crazy as that might sound), accompanied by a very blissful feeling. 
I had a strong desire to please God, and to spread the teachings of Islam to others, particularly non Muslims. I have 
not too long ago made a promise to God as I saw something in reach, I said to him, if I ever become encompassed by 
wealth I will do something very significant in your way and Islam. I had a very ambitious dream, that to my knowledge 
has never been done. And after my time on earth, I would leave it to a trusted member of the family, and so on, to 
carry out this grand and overly ambitious vision and let it forever grow and continue to blossom (God willing).  
InshAllah I will receive the spiritual rewards and mercy of God (in the hereafter) this is the chief reason I truly 
wish to make this project a reality, thus it giving me a great sense of pride. God willing it will still transpire, 
even if something much smaller, this is not hard, and if small it surly will be, God willing. When I thought about it 
then, and still have hopes for it, which was vital to my self assurance and greater happiness. To create something that
has never been created, since maybe only in the Golden Age of Islam, and surly in the time of the Prophet (PBUH), 
something that will impact the country and world in a real and positive way. It is comprised basically of three 
different branches. First, to make known the true Islam of compassion and universal acceptance of people of different 
races and faiths, both male and female. Secondly, provide real support and financial assistance for the poor, disabled,
sick, physically and mentally ill, and elderly. Thirdly, to establish a Growth Fund for such individuals, to grow 
indefinitely and infinitely after my time on earth. Having left a great monument in my name, and my families name,  to be
recognized not only in this world, but more importantly in the heavens. This all by God’s will. The basic organization
plan is already drawn out. If it never comes to pass in full, then God willing it assuredly will in even a small part, as having a
plan for this as well. But at least having known that I intended it, and created a basic model.</p>

			<h1 class="border border-txt">A PERFECT CASUAL DAY WITH A LADY</h1>
			<p>My ideal start of a day with a gracious lady would be to begin with a nice lunch at Mediterranean café or Asian Bistro.
I am definitely indulged by ethnic cuisines and love trying out the newest restaurant on the scene and different exotic 
regional dishes and pallets. Next, we would head to the movies and catch the latest comedy, sci-fi or horror flick 
(no slasher movies, don't worry). I really enjoy a good comedy, my favorites are the old school comedies like the 
National Lampoon’s Vacation movie series. A perfect nights with that special someone would be to dine at an outdoor 
coastal café at sunset, with the ocean breeze overlooking the horizon with seagulls in flight.

			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY IDEAL MATCH</h1>
			<p>My life long partner should be approximately from the age of 35 – 45, preferably not more then late 30's, in order to
conceive a child (but if not then adoption is a suitable option, retaining father's name).</p><p>She must be a moderate practicing Muslim, or of monotheistic  Christian or Jewish general persuasion, but not be a Trinitarian
or believe that Jesus is either God or the Literal Son Of God (figuratively is more proper and acceptable).
She must be moderate in religious practice (not extreme).
My wife must be a non smoker and drinker, nor eat pork, or keep a Christmas tree or cross in the house.
She must be willing to bring up any children as moderate practicing Muslim.</p><p>My wife needs to have a sense of integrity, be honest, faithful, compassionate, sensitive, just, liberal minded. 
My Soul Mate be preferably light hearted with some exhibit of sensual emotion.
It is preferable she enjoys spending time together in different activities, weather be commonly shared or newly tried.
My ideal mate should preferably, but not necessarily, come from a well educated family, but must come from  an
honorable family background. Personal monetary possessions or in the family is not important.
Although physical attractiveness is not nearly as important as inner beauty, appearance is still a vital attribute
for me in the beginning of marriage.</p>
