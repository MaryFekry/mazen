			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY PLANS DURING AND AFTER MARRIAGE</h1>
			<p>
			    
			 My wishes are really fairly simple. I want to have a loving wife and one, perhaps two kids (biological or adoption by 

Islamic guidelines). Live-In help such as Nanny type care should be provided as needed, if my wife is in her late 30’s, 

or chooses to work. Any child must be raised with ample care and love, with God in their lives (not extreme nor too 

liberal). Family to live in comfort but without needless excess. </p>




<p> With a business partner (part owner), I am looking to open a small business in the very near future; successful 

franchise, or acquire an existing business (halal) – no pork, tobacco, alcohol, riba (interest), etc… In fulfillment of

my plan and vision in settling down, entrepreneurship is very appealing to me, as it allows me to be my own boss, in 

control of my own future (except by Gods will), and last but not least have time to spend with family and new friends, 

with much leisure time together. </p>




<p> Nearly immediately after relocating and renting very briefly first, plan to buy in cash full, a modest condo or possibly a single 

family home, with waterfront or a serene view. It is most desirable for me to have my wife’s support and pleasure in finding this 

homestead together. It is vital that we settle down near family (with exceptions to be discussed by partners)

I have family in Tampa suburban, California, Michigan, Virginia Beach, New York city, and Boston.

In  a prime but affordable area, moderate / liberal population mentality, community mosque, good schools, and establish a solid surrounding Muslim 

community (Umah), the area must be conducive to business.  After living practically all my life in Michigan, since moving there

 from Egypt at a the very young age of three, I  believe both the change of scenery and some particular enhanced appeal and perks 

is greatly beneficial. I plan to relocate and settle down in a homestead place be discussed by both wife, husband.</p>

			<h1 class="border border-txt">MY VIEWS ON MARITAL RELATIONS</h1>
		<p>I am a strong believer that the sparks will be either visible early on, or virtually not at all. So I have no intention

in dragging a relation (no pre-marital sex) for a long period of time before deciding to get married. We should be 

truthful and upfront with each other from the early going, and meet each others family. Like I said, the sparks should 

be apparent early on, or never, and if not initially, we should not stay in a relation that will very unlikely spark, 

only to cause heartbreak to the bride, and disappointment to the families involved. I strongly believe their are four 

major reasons for the demise and failure of marriage, with the last often being a bi-product of the first three :a  lack of 

common values, mutual respect, understanding, and unconditional faithfulness. Pride and weakness of basic values of faith, are the 

underling cause of all sin. I also believe that a significant reason for a turbulent marriage and often break up, is the

lack of communication and expression of major expectations primarily before marriage, on the part of the man and woman as well. 

When such maters are left untold until the couple are married it often leads to friction and mistrust. While these differences 

can often be minimized by mutual understanding or negotiated before engagement. Disagreements will arise, 

and it is important to keep in mind any disagreements should be refereed to the best knower, Allah. And when one spouse does 

not see eye to eye with the other, the heart of soul usually knows the answer if one is sincere.  Most importantly if each other is aware of the 

intentions and motives of one another, adhering to the best knowing God, it is much more easily accepted by the heart 

and soul. However ones motives and intentions must be made known by the other, mutually. And when there are 

differences that pose difficulty that can not easily be solved together, or by a friend, the matter should be referred 

to moderate religious authorities, such as a Sheikh or Imam, but not blindly. It should never be forgotten that each 

other have individually different needs, and these needs should be acknowledged sensitively and attended to, and this is

the true meaning of understanding and respect. Pride (not wholly or merited), is the source of much sin, and humility 

is the cleanser of the soul. It is also important to remember no one is perfect, and not to dwell too much on ones 

unusual traits or short comings, this being mutual. It is also a strong moral and religious belief of mine, that 

although the man is generally the bread winner and head of the marriage union, the woman is an equal partner to man, 

and that in marriage, the wife has ample rights (in some cases more than the man for her protection), and should be 

included in major family decisions. This is vital to her happiness, and is the rightful possession. The man is the 

provider, protector, and sustainer (health and well being) of the woman). In my religious view (Islam) during a marriage, 

what ever income is earned by the husband is shared, however, what earnings and belongings of the woman, is hers only (during

marriage, and in event of divorce (which I never seeing myself requesting) unless she chooses of her own will to share 

of her wealth.  However,  it would be a virtue that the spouse so chooses to contribute a portion of her earnings toward the 

family, but only if it would raise the household quality of life (if was needed or desired), or if it would please her. Yet if she has even 

nothing, it is not important, God willing.</p>

<p> Security and well being of my wife and family is a top priority in the very beginning of marriage. I shall make sure that my wife, and 

child (offspring or pre-existing from mother) is well taken care, during my life, and after me, if God shall take me first (only God knows).

To be secured financially as well as have a house to live in, having a surrounding and supporting Umah, and near a Mosque.
